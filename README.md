# EGG - the Explosion Graphics Generator

This is a simple scripting language for implementing particle system graphics effects. It was obviously
written by [Shawn Hargreaves](http://www.shawnhargreaves.com/) in September 1998, and updated
in June 1999 to work under Windows using MSVC, and updated again July 1999 to work under Linux.

See more [here](http://www.shawnhargreaves.com/egg/).

July 2015: As the program is freeware, I (Ren√©) decided to put it on github.

It obviously needs <code>allegro.h</code>.
